- Create an program using libmodbus to test the DSP
- Test cases:
	- Have to consider that the modbus library is working with 32 bits values (float32) and the libmodbus unit test is not passing because it have to accept 16 bits value (request from one register only, for example)
	- Coils / Holding registers:
		- Read 1 value from address 0 to 255 (must be 0)
		- Set 1/0x0001 values single coil func from address 0 to 255
		- Read 8 values from address 0 to (255-8) (must be 1)
		- Read 16 values from address 0 to (255-16) (must be 1)
		- Read 20 values from address 0 to (255-20) (must be 1)
		- Set 0/0x000 values using multiple write func from address 0 to 255 (20 coils per operation; 10 registers per operation)
		- Read values value from address 0 to 255 (must be 0)
	- Inputs / Input Registers:
		- Read 1 values from address 0 to 255
		- Read 8 values from address 0 to (255-8)
		- Read 16 values from address 0 to (255-16)
		- Read 20 values from address 0 to (255-20)
	- Generate exceptions and check the codes (only the implemented ones)
- Comment the code
- Build a better documentation (explaining the lifecycle)
